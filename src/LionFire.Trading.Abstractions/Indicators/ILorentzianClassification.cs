/// <summary>
/// Lorentzian Classification indicator interface.
/// An advanced ML-based indicator that uses Lorentzian distance for K-nearest neighbors classification
/// to predict market direction based on feature patterns.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The Lorentzian Classification indicator:
/// - Uses k-NN with Lorentzian distance metric: L(x,y) = Î£ log(1 + |xi - yi|)
/// - Extracts features: RSI, CCI, ADX, and price momentum components
/// - Stores historical patterns in a circular buffer for efficient lookback
/// - Provides Buy/Sell/Neutral signals with confidence scores
/// - Uses feature normalization for stable distance calculations
/// 
/// Available implementations:
/// - LorentzianClassification_FP: First-party implementation (optimized for streaming data)
/// 
/// Selection: Automatic based on performance profile, or set
/// ImplementationHint in parameters.
/// </remarks>
